= Introduction =

== Development accounting ==
* Why do poor countries have low output per worker? 
  * low capital (and other inputs)
  * low productivity
...
* Consensus blames low productivity. (E.g., Klenow and Rodríguez-Clare, 1997; Hall and Jones, 1999; Caselli, 2005.)
  * More difficult for policy.
  * Need deeper understanding.

== Sector-level development accounting ==
* In which sectors is the productivity gap the largest?
* Important to think about technology adoption and to target policies.
...
* Agricultural productivity varies most. (Caselli, 2005; Restucciaa, Yangb and Zhu, 2008; Duarte and Restuccia, 2010)
* Services productivity is much more similar across countries. (Balassa, 1964; Samuelson, 1964; Baumol, 1966; Baumol and Bowen, 1966; Bailey and Solow, 2001; Duarte and Restuccia, 2012)
...
* Upshot: the road to development leads through the farm.

== This paper ==
1. Land matters.
2. Location matters.
3. They matter relatively more for services.

== An example of two cities ==
== ==
\widetable{beef}{Large productivity difference in producing beef}
\widetable{restaurant}{Smaller productivity difference in restaurant meals}

== Basic idea ==
* We believe development accounting should control for the '''land demand''' and the '''location''' of sectors.
* Without this, services in expensive large cities will be deemed unproductive.
* This matters because rich countries have large service-cities.

== Outline ==
1. A ''simple'' equilibrium model of sector location
2. A first look at the data
3. Calibrating the spatial features to U.S. data:
   internal validation
4. Development accounting in the model



= A model of sector location =
== Technology ==
In each sector $i$ (agriculture, manufacturing, services), technology is Cobb--Douglas:
\[
Q_i(z) = A_i L_i(z)^{\beta_i}N_i(z)^{1-\beta_i}
\]
  * $z$: location of production (see later)
  * $A_i$: Hicks-neutral productivity
  * $L_i$: land (spatially immobile factor)
  * $N_i$: labor (spatially mobile factor)
  * $\beta_i$: land share

== The role of space ==
* Von Thünen monocentric city model: All market exchange takes place in a central business district (CBD).
  * Stand-in for other externalities the city may provide.
* Shipping to distance $z$ entails proportional costs
\[
1 - e^{-\tau_i z}.
\]
$\tau_i$: ''hazard'' of iceberg melting, goods damaged etc. per km

== Aggregation over space ==
* Aggregate value added at producer prices:
\[
\tilde Q_i = \int_{z\in Z_i} \tilde P_i(z)A_i
L_i(z)^{\beta_i}N_i(z)^{1-\beta_z} dz
\]
* Define representative location $\tilde z_i$:
\[
e^{-\frac{\tau_i}{\beta_i}\tilde z_i} = \int_{z\in Z_i} \frac{L_i(z)}{L_i}e^{-\frac{\tau_i}{\beta_i} z}dz
\]
* All aggregates are a function of $\tilde z_i$ only, as if all production happened at that point.


== Productivity ==
* Output per worker
\[
\frac{\tilde Q_i}{N_i} = 
A_i
 \left(
 \frac{L_i}
 {N_i}\right)^{\beta_i}e^{-\tau_i\tilde z_i}.
\]
* Low if
  * productivity is low (technology, capital)
  * land is scarce (especially for land intensive sectors)
  * trade costs are high
  * cities are large
* Interation between sector characteristics ($\beta$, $\tau$) and sector location ($\tilde z$).



= Spatial equilibrium =
== The bid rent curve ==
* Markets are competitive, firms choose location freely.
* Bid-rent curve:
\[
R_i(z) =\beta_i(1-\beta_i)^{1/\beta_i-1} (P_iA_i)^{1/\beta_i} W^{1-1/\beta_i} e^{-\frac{\tau_i}{\beta_i} z}
\]
* Each location goes to the highest bidder.

== ==
\widefigure{fig_spatial_equilibrium}{Spatial equilibrium}

== Spatial equilibrium ==
Sectors sort by $\tau_i/\beta_i$. Less tradable and less land intensive sectors locate closer to cities.
  1. services locate in $[0,z_1]$
  2. manufacturing locates in $(z_1,z_2]$ 
  3. agriculture locates in $(z_2,z_3]$

== Solving for sector location ==
* Take two neighboring sectors. The cutoff between them determines
  1. the relative supply of land in each
  2. the relative price of land in each (by spatial aribtrage)
* Goods market clearing then pins down cutoff.
* Under Cobb--Douglas preferences and technologies, equilibrium spatial structure is independent of development.
* Spatial structure only depends on 
  * sectoral composition $\alpha_i$
  * city size $z_3$



= A first look at the data =

\widefigure{clark-landrents}{Land is no longer important but urban land is (Clark, 2007)}
\widefigure{urbanization}{Rich countries are more urbanized}
\widefigure{largest-cities}{But their cities are similar}

\widefigure{priceserv}{Service prices rise steeply with income}
\widefigure{serviceshare}{Richer countries produce more services}

\widefigure{sector_location_quotients}{Sectors sort as in the model}


= Calibration =
== Road map ==
1. Estimate parameters $\tau$ and $\beta$ from U.S. spatial and NIPA data.
2. Measure country-specific sectoral shares $\alpha$.
3. Infer city size $z_3$ from population of cities in each country.
4. Solve for equilibrium sector locations $\tilde z_1$, $\tilde z_2$, $\tilde z_3$.
5. Conduct productivity decompositions.

== Calibration ==
* We calibrate production and shipping technologies to U.S.
* Land shares come from Herrendorf and Valentinyi (2008): 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|cc}
\hline\hline
Industry    & Capital   &   Land    & Structures+Equipment \\ \hline
GDP         &   0.32    &   0.05    & 0.27 \\ \hline
Agriculture & 0.43      &   0.18    & 0.25      \\
Manufacturing & 0.31    &   0.03    & 0.28      \\
Services    & 0.32      & 0.05      & 0.27      \\ \hline\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
* Complemented with indirect use of land:
  * workers' housing expenditure (0.30 from BLS)
  * of which devoted to land (0.36 from Davis and Palumbo, 2008)

== Sectoral locations ==
* We use the 2007 ZIP Business Patterns to measure sector locations in the U.S.
  * Establishment and employment counts for 38,000 ZIP codes in 6-digit NAICS codes.
* For each ZIP-code, we identify the nearest Urbanized Area (city above 50,000) and calculate its distance.
  * 11215 is 6km from NYC, 07030 is 4km.
* Estimate $\tau_i$ from employment-density gradients for each sector.

== Employment density ==
* Emplyoment per km2 at location $z$,
\[
\frac{N_i(z)}{L_i(z)} = (1-\beta_i)^{1/\beta_i} \left(\frac{P_iA_i}{W}\right)^{1/\beta_i} e^{-\frac{\tau_i}{\beta_i} z}.
\]
* Estimate with Poisson:
\[
\frac{n_{izc}}{l_{izc}} = e^{\mu_c+\nu_i-\gamma_i d(z,c)}.
\]

\widetable{land_shares_and_gradients}{Sectoral land shares and estimated gradients}
\widefigure{fig_linear_avgdist}{Validation of model across U.S.~cities}

== Determining sector locations in other countries ==
* Take global list of cities with population data (45,000) from MaxMind.
* Exogenously divide up country land area across cities ($z_3$).
* Given sector shares $\alpha_i$, solve for sector location in each city ''in isolation''.
* Present results with largest city.

= Development accounting =
== Development accounting ==
* Decompose log output per worker into
\[
\ln\frac{\tilde Q_i}{N_i}
=
\underbrace{\ln A_i}_{\text{productivity}}
+\underbrace{\beta_i(\ln L_i-\ln N_i)}_{\text{land}}
\underbrace{-\tau_i\tilde z_i}_{\text{location}}
\]
* Document, for each sector, how the components vary with development.
  1. Last two components across 191 countries (no productivity data).
  2. All components across 14 EUKLEMS countries (little variation).

= Conclusion =
== Conclusion ==
* Simple macro model with space to talk about sectoral aggregates.
* Services in rich countries would be even more productive in poor cities.
* Agriculture in rich countries would be less productive in poor rural areas.
...
* Productivity dispersion is more similar across sectors than previously thought.

== Takeaway ==
1. Back to square 1: we still don't know which sector drives productivity differences.
...
2. Variation might come from macro policies and institutions and may not be sector specific.



= Appendix =
= Measurement =
== Measuring land ==
=== OECD Manual ``Measuring Capital" ===
Valuing stocks of land is also problematic when land prices vary significantly between locations and applying an ``average" price of land seems liable to significant bias.

=== EUKLEMS ===
Note that we only include fixed reproducible  assets. To have a complete capital accounts, however, land and inventories should also be taken into consideration, as capital compensation in the national accounts includes the user costs of these items as well.

== Measuring prices ==
* Precise consumer and producer prices by location would lead to precise productivity measures.
* However:
  1. Location variation is difficult to track.
  2. Service prices are hard to measure (BLS PPI).
  3. Service trade costs are almost impossible to measure (BEA IO).

= Extensions =
== Multiple cities ==
* Taking city structure as given, estimate $z_1$, $z_2$ and $z_3$ for each city.
* With weighting, patterns are similar to single-city version.
