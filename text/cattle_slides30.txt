= Introduction =

== Development accounting ==
* Why do poor countries have low output per worker? 
  * lower capital (and other inputs)
  * lower productivity
...
* Consensus (Klenow and Rodríguez-Clare, 1997; Hall and Jones, 1999; Caselli, 2005) blames low productivity.
  * More difficult for policy.
  * Need deeper understanding.

== Sector-level development accounting ==
* In which sectors is the productivity gap the largest?
  * Important to think about technology adoption and to target policies.
...
* Agricultural productivity varies most. (Caselli, 2005; Restucciaa, Yangb and Zhu, 2008; Duarte and Restuccia, 2010)
* Services productivity is much more similar across countries. (Balassa, 1964; Samuelson, 1964; Baumol, 1966; Baumol and Bowen, 1966; Bailey and Solow, 2001)
  * Upshot: focus on agriculture, ignore services (also due to data constraints).

== This paper ==
* We believe development accounting should control for the '''location of sectors'''.
* Without this, services in expensive large cities will be deemed unproductive.
  * This matters because rich countries have large service-cities.

== Basic idea ==
* Demand for urban land in developed economies is higher (structural transformation, urbanization, more demand for residential land).
* This bids up urban rents relative to rural rents,
* increasing the price of services even relative to manufacturing and agriculture.

== Outline ==
1. A ''simple'' equilibrium model of sector location
2. Calibrating the spatial features to U.S. data
3. Development accounting in the model (preliminary)


= A model of sector location =
== Technology ==
In each sector $i$ (agriculture, manufacturing, services), technology is Cobb--Douglas:
\[
Q_i(z) = A_i L_i(z)^{\beta_i}N_i(z)^{1-\beta_i}
\]
  * $z$: location of production (see later)
  * $A_i$: Hicks-neutral productivity
  * $L_i$: land (spatially immobile factor)
  * $N_i$: labor (spatially mobile factor)
  * $\beta_i$: land share

== The role of space ==
* Von Thünen monocentric city model: All market exchange takes place in a central business district (CBD).
  * Stand-in for other externalities the city may provide.
* Shipping to distance $z$ entails proportional costs
\[
1 - e^{-\tau_i z}.
\]
$\tau_i$: ''hazard'' of iceberg melting, goods damaged etc. per km
* Markets are competitive, firms choose location freely.
  * Bid-rent curve:
\[
R_i(z) =\beta_i(1-\beta_i)^{1/\beta_i-1} (P_iA_i)^{1/\beta_i} W^{1-1/\beta_i} e^{-\frac{\tau_i}{\beta_i} z}
\]

== ==
\widefigure{bid-rent-2-exp}{Spatial equilibrium}

== Spatial equilibrium ==
Sectors sort by $\tau_i/\beta_i$. Less tradable and less land intensive sectors locate closer.
  1. services locate in $[0,z_1]$
  2. manufacturing locates in $(z_1,z_2]$ 
  3. agriculture locates in $(z_2,z_3]$


== Aggregation over space ==
* Aggregate value added at producer prices:
\[
\tilde Q_i = \int_{z\in Z_i} \tilde P_i(z)A_i
L_i(z)^{\beta_i}N_i(z)^{1-\beta_z} dz
\]
* Define representative location $\tilde z_i$:
\[
e^{-\frac{\tau_i}{\beta_i}\tilde z_i} = \int_{z\in Z_i} \frac{L_i(z)}{L_i}e^{-\frac{\tau_i}{\beta_i} z}dz
\]
* All aggregates are a function of $\tilde z_i$ only, as if all production happened in that point.

== Productivity measurement ==
* Labor productivity (ignoring land)
\[
\frac{\tilde Q_i}{N_i} = \beta_i^{\beta_i}(1-\beta_i)^{-\beta_i} 
A_i
\left(\frac{W}{R_i}\right)^{\beta_i}e^{-\tau_i \tilde z_i}.
 \]
* Relative to $A_i$, biased downwards if:
  * $R_i/W$ is high (rich, high-rent countries)
  * $\beta_i$ is high (land intensive sectors)
  * $\tau_i$ is high (nontradable sectors)
  * $\tilde z_i$ is high (large countries and cities)

== Productivity measurement ==
* Total factor productivity
\[
\frac{\tilde Q_i}{L_i^{\beta_i}N_i^{1-\beta_i}} = 
A_i
 e^{-\tau_i\tilde z_i}.
\]
* Relative to $A_i$, biased downwards if:
  * $\tau_i$ is high (nontradable sectors)
  * $\tilde z_i$ is high (large countries and cities)


= Calibration =
== Calibration ==
* We calibrate production and shipping technologies to U.S.
* Land shares come from Herrendorf and Valentinyi (2008): 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|cc}
\hline\hline
Industry    & Capital   &   Land    & Structures+Equipment \\ \hline
GDP         &   0.32    &   0.05    & 0.27 \\ \hline
Agriculture & 0.43      &   0.18    & 0.25      \\
Manufacturing & 0.31    &   0.03    & 0.28      \\
Services    & 0.32      & 0.05      & 0.27      \\ \hline\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
* Complemented with indirect use of land:
  * workers' housing expenditure (0.30 from BLS)
  * of which devoted to land (0.36 from Davis and Palumbo, 2008)

== Sectoral locations ==
* We use the 2007 ZIP Business Patterns to measure sector locations in the U.S.
  * Establishment and employment counts for 38,000 ZIP codes in 6-digit NAICS codes.
* For each ZIP-code, we identify the nearest Urbanized Area (city above 50,000) and calculate its distance.
  * 11215 is 6km from NYC, 07030 is 4km.
* Infer $\tau_i$ from employment-density gradients for each sector.

\widetable{land_shares_and_gradients}{Sectoral land shares and estimated gradients}

== Determining sector locations in other countries ==
* For each country, count cities above 50,000. Treat them as symmetric (for now).
* Take cities to be circular, so that amount of land $[0,z]$ kms away from center
$L(z) = \pi z^2$.
* Allocate enough land to each sector to match aggregate output:
\[
{L_i}= \frac{Y_i}{W}
(1-\beta_i)^{1-1/\beta_i}\left(\frac{W}{P_iA_i e^{-\tau_i\tilde z_i}}\right)^{1/\beta_i} ,
\]
* Key variation across countries:
  * sector share in GDP
  * unit labor cost of sector
  * country area

== Development accounting ==
* Which sector's productivity varies most with development?
* Compare measured productivity $A_ie^{-\tau_i \tilde z_i}$ and ''location-corrected'' productivity $A_i$ to GDP per capita.
  * GDP per capita from World Development Indicators 2007.
  * Productivity measures from EUKLEMS (14 countries).

= Conclusion =
== Conclusion ==
* Simple macro model with space can be easily calibrated to sectoral aggregates.
* Without accounting for space, measured productivity is biased against large, high-rent locations.
* Correcting for sector location, productivity in services varies as much across countries as in manufacturing.
* We should understand more what drives service productivity.
