  abstract  = "Historically, urban growth required enough development to grow
               and transport significant agricultural surpluses or a government
               effective enough to build an empire. But there has been an
               explosion of poor mega-cities over the last 30 years. A simple
               urban model illustrates that in closed economies, agricultural
               prosperity leads to more urbanization, but that in an open
               economy, urbanization increases with agricultural desperation.
               The challenge of developing world mega-cities is that poverty
               and weak governance reduce the ability to address the negative
               externalities that come with density. This paper models the
               connection between urban size and institutional failure, and
               shows that urban anonymity causes institutions to break down.
               For large cities with weak governments, draconian policies may
               be the only way to curb negative externalities, suggesting a
               painful trade-off between dictatorship and disorder. A simple
               model suggests that private provision of infrastructure to
               reduce negative externalities is less costly when city
               populations are low or institutions are strong, but that public
               provision can cost less in bigger cities.",

               standard interpretation of this fact is that cross-country
               productivity differences are larger in manufacturing than in
               services. The service sector comprises heterogeneous categories.
               We document that the behavior of relative prices is markedly
               different across two broad classifications of services:
               traditional services, such as health and education, feature a
               rising relative price with development and non-traditional
               services, such as communication and transportation, feature a
               falling relative price with income. Using a standard model of
               structural transformation with an input-output structure, we
               find that cross-country productivity differences are much larger
               in non-traditional services (a factor of 106.5-fold between rich
               and poor countries) than in manufacturing (24.5-fold). Moreover,
               this relative productivity difference is reduced by more than
               half when abstracting from intermediate inputs. Development
               requires an emphasis on solving the productivity problem in
               non-traditional services in poor countries.",

              economy-wide efficiency term that affects both sectors uniformly.

Development Accounting is a first-pass attempt at organizing the answer around two proximate determinants: factors of production and efficiency. It answers the question “how much of the cross-country income variance can be attributed to differences in (physical and human) capital, and how much to differences in the efficiency with which capital is used?” Hence, it does for the cross-section what growth accounting does in the time series. The current consensus is that efficiency is at least as important as capital in explaining income differences. I survey the data and the basic methods that lead to this consensus, and explore several extensions. I argue that some of these extensions may lead to a reconsideration of the evidence."

And, since 1998, almost all large US cities have seen significant increases in real residential land prices. Averaging across the cities in our sample, by year-end 2004, the value of residential land accounted for about 50 percent of the total market value of housing, up from 32 percent in 1984. An implication of our results is that housing is much more land intensive than it used to be, meaning that the future course of home prices—the average rate of appreciation and volatility—is likely to be determined even more by demand factors than was the case even ten or twenty years ago."

abstract ={We investigate the role of sectoral labor productivity in explaining the process of structural transformation—the secular reallocation of labor across sectors—and the time path of aggregate productivity across countries. We measure sectoral labor productivity across countries using a model of the structural transformation. Productivity differences across countries are large in agriculture and services and smaller in manufacturing. Over time, productivity gaps have been substantially reduced in agriculture and industry but not nearly as much in services. These sectoral productivity patterns generate implications in the model that are broadly consistent with the cross-country data. We find that productivity catch-up in industry explains about 50% of the gains in aggregate productivity across countries, whereas low productivity in services and the lack of catch-up explain all the experiences of slowdown, stagnation, and decline observed across countries.},

On an accounting basis our analysis shows that differences in physical capital and educational attainment can only partially explain the variation in output per worker-we find a large amount of variation in the level of the Solow residual across countries. At a deeper level, we document that the differences in capital accumulation, productivity, and therefore output per worker are driven by differences in institutions and government policies, which we call social infrastructure. We treat social infrastructure as endogenous, determined historically by location and other factors captured in part by language.},

     abstract = {In our view there has been a "Neoclassical Revival" in growth economics spurred by the empirical findings of Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992), Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995), and Young (1994 and 1995). By this we mean a revival of the neoclassical growth model-which features a common level of productivity but different levels of human and physical capital across countries-as a viable candidate for explaining the major part of country differences in levels and growth rates of output per worker. Marshaling existing evidence from the labor literature on the returns to schooling and experience, we construct new measures of human capital across countries. We find that productivity differences are the dominant source of the large international dispersion in levels and growth rates of output per worker. We conclude that, although models that focus on physical and human capital are clearly important, research needs to be re-focused on explaining the causes of productivity differences across countries.},

Although growth accounts are the organising principle, it is argued that the database is useful for a wider range of applications. We give some guidance to prudent use and indicate possible extensions.},

Using a two-sector general-equilibrium model, we show that differences in economy-wide productivity, barriers to modern intermediate inputs in agriculture, and barriers in the labor market generate large cross-country differences in the share of employment and labor productivity in agriculture. The model implies a factor difference of 10.8 in aggregate labor productivity between the richest and the poorest 5% of the countries in the world, leaving the unexplained factor at 3.2. Overall, this two-sector framework performs much better than a single-sector growth model in explaining observed differences in international productivity."

We also decompose the capital shares into the income shares of land, structures, and equipment. We find that the capital shares differ across sectors. For example, the capital share of agriculture is more than two times that of construction and more than 50% larger than that of the aggregate economy. Moreover, agriculture has by far the largest land share, which mostly explains why it has the largest capital share. Our numbers can directly be used to calibrate standard multi-sector models. Alternatively, if one wants to abstract from differences in sector capital shares, our numbers can be used to establish that this is not crucial for the results."
